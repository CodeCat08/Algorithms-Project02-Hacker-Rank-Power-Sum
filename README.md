# Algorithms-Project02-Hacker-Rank-Power-Sum
This program finds the number of ways that a given integer,'X' , can be expressed as the sum of the 'N'th powers of unique, natural numbers. For example, if  'X' = 13 and 'N' = 2, we have to find all combinations of unique squares adding up to '13'. The only solution is 2^2 + 3^2. 'X' is the number to sum to. 'N' is the integer power to raise numbers to.
